This repo contains some simple ansible playbooks. This was previously done as part of advancing my ansible skills, I'm moving them here for others to refer to. Later on, we'd move to refactoring ansible. Feel free to reach out to me for more information. Always happy to help out DevOps enthusiast. **I wrote an article about a blocker I experienced while trying to run my playbook. The problem was related to my SSH-Agent.**
